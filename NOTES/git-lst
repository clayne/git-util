Minuses to fix:
* Uh oh, I forgot what I was going to write here
* git lst FILE  reports the right time, but claims that the file is named '.'

Plusses to add:
* command-line flag to set time output format
* flag to say whether to mention files that no longer exist
* flag to say whether to recurse into subdirs (easy)
* flag to say whether to mention dates that files were modified in the
  working tree
* option to specify last commit date relative to *which branch*
* output format using --format=%ai etc.
* More than one argument
  * git lst file file file
  * git lst dir1 dir2

Questions:
* What if a file was added, removed, then added back?  List the dates for both files?
  * No, this tool isn't a replacement for git-log.  It's for a first look, not for every detail.
