Minuses to fix:
* Uh oh, I forgot what I was going to write here
* git lst FILE  reports the right time, but claims that the file is named '.'

Plusses to add:
* command-line flag to set time output format
* flag to say whether to mention files that no longer exist
* flag to say whether to recurse into subdirs (easy)
* flag to say whether to mention dates that files were modified in the
  working tree
