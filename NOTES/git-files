This is useful, but:

1. Its default behavior is awful; it lists the current branch back to
   the beginning of the universe and it produces no output until it
   has finished.  Instead of piping through `sort -u`, pipe it through
   an online uniquer like

     perl -nle 'print unless $seen{$_}++'

2. At present it passes options to git-log.  This is good, but it
   means that it can't be used with my nice `git mine` alias.  Maybe
   if the first argument does not begin with a hyphen, shift it off
   and use it in place of `log` so for example

      git files mine -8          # git-mine -8 | ...
      git files --author=mjd -8  # (the same)
      git files -8               # git-log  -8 | ...
