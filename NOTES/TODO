A git-commit hook that refuses to commit a change that adds a line
that matches 'DO NOT COMMIT', or 'XXX'.  Actually RJBS has a better
suggestion: "I'd rather have something like that which prevents it
from being committed to (or merged to) branch master".

Fix up git-ff-branch to display a summary of changes like the one tht
git-merge does when it fast-forwards the current branch.

git-re-edit needs to be able to take a range of commits and edit all
the files changed by any of those commits.  I'd like to implement that
as part of a general git-what-changed command that just lists the
files that changed in a commit or commits.  Picking the filenames out
of git-diff --stat with its stupid abbreviating behavior is getting
old.  Then I would also remove the -c flag from git-re-edit.

git-re-edit should also get a flag to tell it to only edit the files
that have a conflicted merge state.  That would be useful for fixing
up conflicted merges.

git-what-changed will emit the names of files that no longer exist.
For example, if you create file foo, then move it to bar,
git-what-changed will emit both names.  The default should emit bar
but not foo.

2013-09-13: Combine git-what-changed with git-vee to emit all the
files that have been touched since this branch diverged from branch X,
either master or its tracked branch.
