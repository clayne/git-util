A git-commit hook that refuses to commit a change that adds a line
that matches 'DO NOT COMMIT'.

Fix up git-ff-branch to display a summary of changes like the one tht
git-merge does when it fast-forwards the current branch.

git-re-edit needs to be able to take a range of commits and edit all the files changedby any of those commits. 
I'd like to implement that as part of a general git-what-changed command that just lists the files that changed in a
commit or commits.  Picking the filenames out of git-diff --stat with its stupid abbreviating behavior is getting old.
Then I would also remove the -c flag from git-re-edit.
