git-re-edit needs to be able to take a range of commits and edit all
the files changed by any of those commits.  I'd like to implement that
as part of a general git-what-changed command that just lists the
files that changed in a commit or commits.  Picking the filenames out
of git-diff --stat with its stupid abbreviating behavior is getting
old.  Then I would also remove the -c flag from git-re-edit.

git-what-changed will emit the names of files that no longer exist.
For example, if you create file foo, then move it to bar,
git-what-changed will emit both names.  The default should emit bar
but not foo.

2013-09-13: Combine git-what-changed with git-vee to emit all the
files that have been touched since this branch diverged from branch X,
either master or its tracked branch.
