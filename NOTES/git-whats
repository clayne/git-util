The whole mechanism here is kind of stupid.  Why not see if you can
use git-notes to store the information you want?

  git-notes is wrong for this; it annotates objects, not refs.  just
  stick a file under .git/.  Or perhaps simplest: can use git-config
  branch.branchname.whats.  This seems to work just fine.

Needs a git-commit hook that detects when you are making a commit to a
nonmaster branch that has no .whats file, prompts you for a
message. and then redoes the commit. It should also detect a merge and
prompt you for a new message, or, if the merge is to master, destroys
the .whats file automatically.
