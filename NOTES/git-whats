Needs a git-commit hook that detects when you are making a commit to a
nonmaster branch that has no .whats file, prompts you for a
message. and then redoes the commit. It should also detect a merge and
prompt you for a new message, or, if the merge is to master, destroys
the .whats file automatically.
