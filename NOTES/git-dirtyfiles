git-dirtyfiles should also get a flag to tell it to only edit the files
that have a conflicted merge state.  That would be useful for fixing
up conflicted merges.

What should git-dirtyfiles do when files are deleted from the
repository?  At present it has bad behavior: it tries to list them
recursively, and the find command it uses fails because the root it's
told to search doesn't exist.  But the real problem is that you don't
know yet what the correct behavior should be.
